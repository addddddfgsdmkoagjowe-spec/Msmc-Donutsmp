# MSMC-Donutsmp
## About:
msmc is a minecraft account checker that checks through microsoft xbox login instead of the older mojang login.
it supports http(s), socks4, socks5 proxies but they must be pretty decent because microsofts authentication is very protective. it also uses tor proxies. it auto installs tor for you if selected.

## Proxy Format:
`user:pass@ip:port` and `ip:port`

## Captures:
- xbox game pass/xbox game pass ultimate accounts
- minecraft capes
- optifine cape
- email access
- last name change
- Donutsmp - Money ; Shards ; Playtime ; Kills ; Deaths ; Blocks Broken ; Blocks placed ; Mobs killed

## Installing:
MSMC ONLY SUPPORTS WINDOWS IT WILL NOT WORK ON LINUX OR MACOS

You do not need to install tor. Tor is automatically installed when selected for proxies.
